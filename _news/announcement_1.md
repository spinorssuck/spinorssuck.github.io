So, what exactly are my grad school plans? Basically, I will NOT be going to grad school perhaps for a year or two, well, firstly due to some financial circumstances. I also had to take two semesters off so I will be graduating a year late. 

Firstly, certain circumstances have forced me to consider seriously taking up employment, perhaps as a data scientist or software engineer or actuary or something. I am also considering applying for a masters program after that for various other reasons. Of course, there are not any rigorous math masters programs in the US, so I will have to do it elsewhere like Canada or some other country, this will be a rather confusing process I think.
