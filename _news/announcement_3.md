AI've been dealing with a bout of serious depression and so will be taking this semester off(Spring 2022) and might probably take up a tech internship over the summer if I am fine. 

(I did not actually want to go public about any of this) however, I did because I think such things are not more openly talked about, and repressed in general societal discourse. Lots of people face such struggles, and navigate whatever life brings them. I still have the hope that I will get better soon enough...
