# Introduction

The Nekrasov Conjecture(theorem) basically predicts a relation between the SUSY $$ N=2 $$ Yang-Mills and the Seiberg-Witten prepotential. So in 1994, Seiberg and Witten discovered an exact description of the low-energy behavior of certain supersymmetric gauge theories. Nekrasov later proposed a kind of regularized partition function $$Z$$ to be defined on this.

Certain consequences of supersymmetry make this partition function also the partition function of a gas of *instantons*. Instantons are self-dual solutions of the Yang-Mills equations in the compactified euclidean 4-space. An interesting thing is that these instanton solutions of the Yang-Mills equations absolutely minimize the energy functional within their topological type. Indeed, in a standard quantum mechanics course, you may have come across the double-well potential where tunelling takes place, this is an example of the *instanton effect*. So this motivates some ideas for the QFT scenario, that is, a naive vacuum may not be the true vacuum of a field theory.

The Seibeg-Witten potential is defined via period integrals of certain hyperelliptic curves. Nekrasov himself eventually resolved this problem in 2003 using physical intuition and 'comapring the infrared and ultraviolet limits' of the gauge theories. On the other, Nakajima who also provided a solution for 4D pure gauge theory with gauge group $$ U(r) $$ also provided a radically different solution using certain moduli spaces of blowups. We will actually be discussing Nakajima's result in this post. 

# Physical description

One can calculate vacuum expectation values of certain gauge theory observables. These observables are annihilated by a combination of the supercharges, and their expectation value is not sensitive to various parameters, the energy scale in particular. So, one can do the calculation either in the ultraviolet region(where the theory is weakly coupled and the instantons dominate), or in the infrared region, and then we can possibly relate the solution to the Seiberg-Witten prepotential of the effective low-energy theory. 

# Nekrasov Partition Function

The Nekrasov partition function is the generating function of the integral of the equivariant cohomology class $$ 1 \in H_{\tilde{T}}^{*}(M(r,n)):

$$ Z(\epsilon_{1},\epsilon_{2},\vec{a}; \mathfrak{q}) = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} \int_{M(r,n)} 1 $$

where $$ \epsilon_{1},\epsilon_{2},\vec{a} $$ are generators of $$ H_{\tilde{T}}^{*}(pt) $$.

Nekrasov's conjecture states that $$ F^{inst}(\epsilon_{1},\epsilon_{2},\vec{a};\mathfrak{q}) = \epsilon_{1} \epsilon_{2} logZ(\epsilon_{1},\epsilon_{2},\vec{a};\mathfrak{q})$$ is regular at $$ \epsilon_{1} = \epsilon_{2} = 0 $$ and $$  F^{inst}(0,0,\vec{a};\mathfrak{q}) $$ is the instanton part of the Seiberg-Witten prepotential for $$

## Seiberg-Witten Prepotential

We'll review the definition of the prepotential via the standard method, that is, via a family of hyperelliptic curves parametrized by $$ \vec{u} = (u_{2},\cdots,u_{r}) $$

$$ C_{\vec{u}} : \Lambda^{r}(w+ \frac{1}{w}) = P(z) = z^{r}+u_{2}z^{r-2}+u_{3}z^{r-3}+ \cdots +u_{r} $$
. These are the *Seiberg-Witten curves*. The projection $$ C_{\vec{a}} \mapsto \mathbb{P}^{1} $$ via $$(w,z) \mapsto z $$

Let $$ z_{1},\cdots,z_{r} $$ be the solutions of $$P(z)=0 $$. Then, we can find $$ z_{\alpha}^{\pm} = \pm 2\Lambda^{r} $$ where $$ \lvert u \rvert \gg \lvert \Lambda \rvert $$. These are the $$2r-$$ branched points of the projection above. 

The hyperelliptic curve $$C_{\vec{u}} $$ is made up of two copies of the Riemann sphere glued along the r-cuts between $$ z_{\alpha}^{-}$$ and $$z_{\alpha}^{+}$$. Let $$A_{\alpha} $$ be the cycle encircling the cut between the two points and then we have $$ \sum_{\alpha} A_{\alpha} = 0 $$. We consider cycles $$ B_{\alpha} $$ so that $$ \{A_{\alpha},B_{\alpha} \vert \alpha = 2,\cdots,r \} $$ form a symplectic basis of $$ H_{1}(C_{\vec{u}}, \mathbb{Z}) $$.

Then, we can finally define the *Seiberg-Witten differential* by 

$$ dS:= \frac{-1}{2\pi} z \frac{dw}{w} = \frac{-1}{2\pi} \frac{zP'(z)dz}{\sqrt{P(z)^{2} - 4 \Lambda^{2r}}} $$

this is a meromorphic differential having poles at $$ \pm \infty $$. We then define functions $$ a_{\alpha}, a_{\beta}^{D} $$ on the u-plane such that

$$ a_{\beta}^{D} = 2\pi i \int_{B_{\beta}} dS $$

$$ a_{\alpha} = \int_{A_{\alpha}} dS $$

Again, we have that $$ \sum a_{\alpha} = 0 $$

Thus, there exists a locally defined function $$ \mathcal{F(\vec{a};\Lambda)} $$ on the $$ \vec{u}- $$ plane such that,

$$ a_{\alpha}^{D} = -\frac{\partial \mathcal{F}}{\partial a_{\alpha}} $$

This is called the *Seiberg-Witten prepotential*. 

Essentially, what is happening here is that the low energy effective Wilsonian action for the massless vector multiplets $$ (a_{\alpha}) $$ is governed by the prepotential $$ \mathcal{F}(\vec{a};\Lambda) $$ which received one-loop perturbative and instanton non-perturbative corrections 

$$ \mathcal{F}(\vec{a};\Lambda) = \mathcal{F}^{pert}(\vec{a};\Lambda) + \mathcal{F}^{inst}(\vec{a};\Lambda) $$

 where the latter term is also a power series in $$ \Lambda $$ (see ahead for some details)

The instanton measure tends to get very complicated with the growth of the instanton charge, adn the integrals are hard to evaluate. Nekrasov attempted to solve this problem via the localiation technique.

that is, one should study $$ G \times \mathbb{T}^{2} $$ equivariant cohomology of the moduli space $$ \tilde{\mathcal{M}_{k}} $$ where $$ G $$ acts by rotating the guage orientation of the instantion at infinity, and $$ \mathbb{T}^{2} $$ si the maximal torus of $$ SO(4) $$ which also acts naturally on the above moduli space. 

Consider $$ p : \tilde{\mathcal{M}_{k}} \to pt $$ the collapse map and the quantity,

$$ Z(\epsilon_{1},\epsilon_{2},\vec{a};q) = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty} q^{k} \int_{\tilde{\mathcal{M}_{k}}} 1 $$

where $$ \int 1 $$ denotes the *localization* of the pushforward $$ p_{*}(1) $$ of $$ 1 \in H_{G \times \mathbb{T}^{2}}(\tilde{\mathcal{M}_{k}})$$ in $$ H_{G \times \mathbb{T}^{2}}(pt) = \mathbb{C}[\epsilon_{1},\epsilon_{2}, \mathcal{U}] $$

One can show that $$\mathcal{F}$$ has the following behavior at $$\Lambda \to 0 $$:

$$\mathcal{F} = \sum\limits_{\alpha < \beta}[(a_{\alpha}-a_{\beta})^{2}log(\frac{i (a_{\alpha}-a_{\beta})}{\Lambda} - \frac{3}{2}(a_{\alpha} - a_{\beta})^{2})] + \Lambda^{2r}.O(\Lambda^{2r}$$

The first part here is the *perturbative part* and the second part is the *instanton part*. To understand this derivation, see this.

Now, consider the period matrix of $$C_{\vec{u}}$$, $$\tau_{\alpha \beta} $$

Note that here $$\tau_{\alpha \beta} = -\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \frac{\partial^{2} \mathcal{F}}{\partial a_{\alpha} \partial a_{\beta}} $$

Consider $$\mathfrak{sl}_{r}$$ and its Cartan subalgebra $$\mathfrak{h}$$. Let $$ \Delta \subset \mathfrak{h}^{*} $$ be the set of roots, then consider the simple root $$ \alpha_{i} \in \mathfrak{h}^{*} $$ for $$ i=1,\cdots,r-1 $$, that is, $$\alpha_{i} = (0,\cdots,1,-1,0,\cdots,0)$$ where the $$1$$ is in the $$ith$$ position and $$-1$$ is obviously in the $$(i+1)th$$ position. Accordingly, we also have the set of positive roots, $$\Delta_{+} = \{e_{\alpha \beta} \}$$. Given $$ \vec{a} = (a_{1},\cdots,a_{r}) $$ then $$\langle \vec{a},e_{\alpha \beta} \rangle = a_{\alpha} - a_{\beta} $$

Let $$ Q $$ be the coroot lattice of $$\mathfrak{h}$$.

The perturbative part can be rewritten as:

$$ \sum_{\Delta_{+}} [\langle \vec{a},\alpha \rangle log(\frac{i \langle \vec{a}, \alpha \rangle}{\Delta} - \frac{3}{2}\langle \vec{a},\alpha \rangle^{2})] $$

The period matrix here is:

$$ \tau_{ij} = \frac{i}{\pi} \langle alpha_{i}^{\vee},\alpha \rangle \langle \alpha_{j}^{\vee}, \alpha \rangle log(\frac{i \langle \vec{a},\alpha \rangle}{\Lambda}) + \Lambda^{2r}.O(\Lambda^{2r}) $$

There are also 2 formulas that will be needed ahead.

$$ \frac{\partial \mathcal{F}}{\partial log \Lambda} = -2ru_{2} $$

This is known as the *renormalization group equation*.

$$ \frac{\partial u_{2}}{\partial log \Lambda} = - \frac{2r}{\pi i} \frac{\partial u_{2}}{\partial a^{i}} \frac{\partial u_{2}}{\partial a^{j}} \frac{\partial}{\partial \tau_{ij}} log\Theta_{E}(\vec{0} \vert \tau) $$

where 
$$ \Theta_{E}(\vec{\eta} \vert \tau) = \sum_{\vec{k} \in Q} exp(\pi i \sum_{i,j}\tau_{i,j} k^{i}k^{j} + 2\pi i \sum_{i} k^{i}(\eta^{i} + \frac{1}{2})) $$

This one is the *contact term equation* .

Unlike Nekrasov's original proof, this proof by Nakajima relies on some clever algebraic geometry, using moduli spaces on $$\mathbb{P}^{2}$$

# Setting up the Proof

## Moduli spaces

In particular, we will be dealing with framed moduli spaces on $$\mathbb{P}^{2} $$, where we will prove analogous results as the Hilbert scheme calculations for $$\mathbb{C}^{2}$$. 

Let $$M(r,n)$$ be the framed moduli space of torsion-free sheaves on $$\mathbb{P}^{2}$$ with rank $$r$$ and $$c_{2}=n$$ which parametrizes isomorphism classes of $$(E,\phi)$$ such that

(1) $$ E $$ is torsion-free sheaf of rank $$r$$, $$\langle c_{2}(E),[\mathbb{P}^{2}] \rangle = n $$ which is locally free in a neighborhood of $$l_{\infty}$$.

(2) $$ \phi:E \vert_{l_{\infty}} \to \mathcal{O}_{l_{\infty}}^{\oplus r}$$ is an isomorphism called *framing at infinity*.

$$ l_{\infty} = \{ [0:z_{1}:z_{2}] \in \mathbb{P}^{2} \} \subset \mathbb{P}^{2} $$

 is the line at infinity. 

Firstly, we have a quick $$Ext$$ calculation
## Lemma 1
$$Hom(E,E(-l_{\infty})) = Ext^{2}(E,E(-l_{\infty})) = 0 $$

### Proof of Lemma 1

This can easily done using the Grothendieck-Serre duality, using the multiplication by $$z_{0}$$ map and finally the Serre vanishing theorem.

## Corollary 1.1
$$ M(r,n) $$ is a nonsingular variety of dimension $$ 2nr $$

### Proof of Lemma 2
(Riemann-Roch + Lemma 1)

## Reframing our framed moduli spaces
(sorry for the cheap pun)

Anyways, some of these details are quite complex and they will somewhat dealt with in Appendix 1. 

But basically, the idea is that $$ M(r,n) $$ is isomorphic to special kind of quotient space, that is, the quotient space of all 4 of $$B_{1},B_{2} \in End(\mathbb{C^{n}}),i \in Hom(\mathbb{C}^{r},\mathbb{C}^{n}),j \in Hom(\mathbb{C}^{n},\mathbb{C}^{r}) $$ satisfying:

(1) $$ [B_{1},B_{2}] + ij = 0 $$
(2) there exists no proper subspace $$ S \subset \mathbb{C}^{n} $$ such that $$B_{t}(S) \subset S(t=1,2) $$ and $$ im(i) \subset S$$

modulo the action of $$GL_{n}(\mathbb{C})$$ given by,
$$ g.(B_{1},B_{2},i,j) = (gB_{1}g^{-1},gB_{2}g^{-1},gi,jg^{-1}) $$

It can be shown that (1) is surjective and the action is free on stable points, this proves that $$ M(r,n)$$ is smooth. 

Also, let $$M_{0}(r,n)$$ be the framed moduli space of ideal instantons of $$S^{4}$$, which is given by 

$$ M_{0}(r,n) = \bigcup\limits_{k=0}^{n} M_{0}^{reg}(r,k) \times Sym^{n-k}(\mathbb{C}^{2}) $$

where $$ M_{0}^{reg}(r,k) $$ is the framed moduli space of genuine instantons and the other factor is the symmetric product. 

From Lemma 2 of Appendix 2, $$ M_{0}^{reg}(r,n) $$ can be identified with the framed moduli space of locally-free sheaves on $$\mathbb{P}^{2}$$ and also with the same space of linear data $$(B_{1},B_{2},i,j) $$ as above but with the extra condition that (2) is also satisfied by the transposes $$ B_{1}\mathsf{T},B_{2}\mathsf{T},j\mathsf{T} $$. Then, from Lemma 3 of Appendix 2,

$$ M_{0}(r,n) $$ can be identified(as a top space) with the GIT quotient

$$ \{(B_{1},B_{2},i,j) \vert [B_{1},B_{2}] + ij = 0} // GL_{n}(\mathbb{C}) $$ 

By Lemma 4 of Appendix 2, $$M(r,n)$$ also has the structure of a hyper-Kahler manifold of dimension $$4nr$$. Indeed, $$M(r,n)$$ is isomorphic to the quotient

$$ \{(B_{1},B_{2},i,j) \vert [B_{1},B_{2}] + ij=0 , [B_{1},B_{2}^{*}] + ii^{*}-j^{*}j = \zeta id \} / U(n) $$
